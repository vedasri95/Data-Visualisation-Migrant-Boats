            <p>The map shows a visual representation of the migrant flows over three years
              from the Isla de Sueno towards United States and Mexico. Each point on the map
              represent an event registered by the US Coast Guard: a green point represent
              a landing point of the boat; a red point represent an interdiction of the Coast
              Guard in that position. The map and the linked displays with charts and statistics
              allow to understand the evolution of the migration during the three years.</p>
            <p>The number of boats has increased along the years. On average there are 150 more
              attempts with respect to the previous year. The proportion of the three types of
              vessels (Rustic, Raft, Go Fast) is constant. There is no evidence that a vessel
              type is more effective than the others. Considering the respective group of
              records of type <a href="#" class="RecordType">Landing</a> and
              <a href="#" class="RecordType">Interdiction</a>, the ratio of the three type
              of vessels is comparable.</p>
            <p>The effectiveness of the Coast Guard during the three years shows an interdiction
              every two attempts, with a success rate of around 51%. However, this performance
              has lowered during the years. In <a href="#" class="Year">2005</a> it was around
              70%. In <a href="#" class="Year">2006</a> has lowered to 56%, and in
              <a href="#" class="Year">2007</a> to 42%.</p>
